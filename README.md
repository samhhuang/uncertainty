## Abstract
### This paper investigates the relationship between uncertainty, consumption, and housing sector. Using quarterly data from 1987Q1 to 2019Q4, I estimate coefficients by a 5-equation Structural Vector Autoregressive (SVAR) model. I found that the Economic Policy Uncertainty Policy Index has more ability than interest rate spread to explain the boom and bust of housing market. The impulse response suggests that the housing output has been significantly affected by the shock of housing price and durable goods consumption. Future research avenues are also provided.
